description: There are many creative ways to make your home work for you.  Home modification means changing or adapting the home in order to make household tasks easier, reduce accidents, and support independent living.  As therapists, we do this everyday and now our knowledge can be available to you.  With Enduring Home Solutions, we will partner with you while providing a therapist perspective to your solution.  This could be simple from rearranging furniture or installing swing clear door hinges to the very complex cases where significant mobility equipment and assistance is required.  We are experts in finding solutions for every budget.  If you seek to modify your home’s floor plan, we can also provide invaluable consultations.  We will help you make thoughtful and adaptable changes to your home to meet your goals and improve your quality of life.
